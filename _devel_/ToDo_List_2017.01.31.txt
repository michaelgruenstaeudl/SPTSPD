    GENERAL ISSUES:
        (a) Include a function to check internet connectivity.
        (b) Functionality for making ends fuzzy.
        (c) Move lists like valid_INSDC_quals into global variables file,
            so that they don't mess up code.
        (d) Move start and stop codon specs into global variables file,
            so that they don't mess up the code.
        (e) Find a better parsing for 'True'/'False' than strtobool(eu_subm_mode);
            ideally, people can also enter 'T'/'F' and '0'/'1'.
        (f) Make section "6.9.1. Modify ID and AC line for first-time submissions"
            its own function in a class.
        (g) Introduce fuzzy ends when leading or trailing Ns were removed (section 6.8.)
        (h) Move the bool decision before section 1 into argparse

    REGARDING CHECKINGOPS().QUALIFIERCHECK().QUALITY_OF_QUALIFIERS():
        (a) Check if sequence_names are also in .nex-file
        (b) Have all metadata conform to basic ASCII standards (not 
            extended ASCII)!

    REGARDING CHECKINGOPS().CHECKCOORD().TRANSL_AND_QUALITY_OF_TRANSL():
        (a) Adjust code of AnnoCheck.check() so that the start position of a 
            subsequent feature is also adjusted.                
        (b) Adjust the location position in code of AnnoCheck.check() so 
            that the stop codon is also included.
        (c) SHOULD EXAMPLE 2 NOT RESULT IN A FEATURE LOCATION THAT ENDS 
            AT ExactPosition(5), I.E. AFTER THE STOP CODON ???
    
    REGARDING PARSINGOPS().GETENTREZINFO():
        (a) Concerning class GetEntrezInfo, the staticmethod 
        `_taxname_lookup` only returns the hitcount ('Count'), 
        which may indicate that the taxon name was found as a valid taxon 
        name or as a valid synonym. If it is the latter, it would be better 
        to save the id_name, pull out the main taxon name via 
        `Entrez.epost('gene', id=','.join(entrez_id_list))` and return 
        the main taxon name instead of the hitcount.

    REGARDING GENERATESEQFEATURE().REGULAR_FEAT():
        (a) Automatically identify a SeqFeature (e.g. search for the 
            type in a database)

    REGARDING GETENTREZINFO()._TAXNAME_LOOKUP():
        (a) This static method only returns the hitcount ('Count'), 
        which may indicate that the taxon name was found as a valid taxon 
        name or as a valid synonym. If it is the latter, it would be better 
        to save the id_name, pull out the main taxon name via 
        `Entrez.epost('gene', id=','.join(entrez_id_list))` and return 
        the main taxon name instead of the hitcount.

- The legacy WEBIN interface does not accept, if a sequence starts with Ns.

*annonex2embl*
==============

Converts an annotated DNA multi-sequence alignment (in [NEXUS](http://wiki.christophchamp.com/index.php?title=NEXUS_file_format) format) to an EMBL flatfile for submission to [ENA](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena) via the [Webin-CLI submission tool](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli_05.html).


## INSTALLATION
```
python2 setup.py install  # Installation
python2 setup.py test     # Testing
```

## FILE PREPARATION
The annotations of a NEXUS file are specified via [SETS-block](http://hydrodictyon.eeb.uconn.edu/eebedia/index.php/Phylogenetics:_NEXUS_Format), which is located beneath a DATA-block and defines sets of characters in the DNA alignment. In such a SETS-block, every gene and every exon charset must be accompanied by one CDS charset. Other charsets can be defined unaccompanied.

#### Example of a complete SETS-BLOCK
```
BEGIN SETS;
CHARSET trnK_intron_forward = 0-928 2531-2813 2849-3152;
CHARSET matK_gene_forward = 929-2530;
CHARSET matK_CDS_forward = 929-2530;    # Accompanying the charset matK_gene
CHARSET trnK_exon_reverse = 2814-2848;
CHARSET trnK_CDS_reverse = 2814-2848;   # Accompanying the charset trnK_exon
CHARSET psbA_gene_forward = 3153-3200;
CHARSET psbA_CDS_forward = 3153-3200;   # Accompanying the charset psbA_gene
END;
```

## USAGE
#### Example with supplied test data
```
SCRPT=$PWD/scripts/annonex2embl_CMD.py
INPUT=examples/DNA_Alignment.nex
METAD=examples/Metadata.csv
DESCR="description of alignment"
EMAIL=your_email_here@gmail.com
AUTHR="Your_name_here"

# UNIX / MacOS
python2 $SCRPT -n $INPUT -c $METAD -o ${INP%.nex*}.embl -d $DESCR -e $EMAIL -a $AUTHR

# Windows
python %SCRPT% -n %INPUT% -c %METAD% -o output.embl -d %DESCR% -e %EMAIL% -a %AUTHR%
```

<!---
NOT NECCESARY AT THIS POINT
#### 0. Implement improvements of argparser (scripts/annonex2embl_CMD.py)
* Currently, the "required" and "optional" parameters are not displayed currently when calling scripts/annonex2embl_CMD.py. It incorrectly says "optional parameters" for all.
* Currently, --taxcheck requires "True" of "False" as parameters; how can I use it such that only the presence of --taxcheck indicates "True", whereas its abscence indicates "False"?
#### 0. Write GUI with similar to GUI of EMBL2checklists
--->

<!---
* NO LONGER NECESSARY: 0. Add a function that (a) reads and parses a bibtex file, extracts the citation info as well as the submitter references as from that file, and write the correctly formatted string-lines into the EMBL output file during post-processing.

## DEVELOPMENT
#### Testing for development
To run the unittests outside of 'python setup.py test':
```
python -m unittest discover -s annonex2embl/tests -p "*_test.py"
```
